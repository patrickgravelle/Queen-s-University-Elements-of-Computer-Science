The second assignment of the undergraduate level course "CISC 101 - Elements of Computer Science" at Queen's University, taught by Dr. Alan McLeod, in the Winter Semester of 2017.

## Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to write a single function in Python that allows the user the play a game of "Pig" with random dice rolls. Both the user and computer players scores are kept until a winner is determined.
